# NearIT Titanium SDK

NearIT allows to engage app users by sending **context-aware targeted content**.

## Recipes

NearIT allows to manage apps by defining *recipes*. Those are simple rules made of 3 ingredients:
- **WHO**: define the target users
- **WHAT**: define what action NearIT should do
- **TRIGGER**: define when the action should be triggered

## How it works

[**NearIT web interface**](https://go.nearit.com/) allows you to configure all the features, in a snap.
Once the settings are configured, **everyone** - even people without technical skills - can manage context-aware mobile contents.

**NearIT SDK** synchronize with servers and behave accordingly to the settings and the recipes. Any content will be delivered at the right time, you just need to handle its presentation.
